# AdiBags TradeableLoot

Forked from AdiBags_Bound. https://github.com/AvyAddons/AdiBags_Bound

This fork adds a Filter to help a masterlooter filter out BoE and items with a loot Timer in their own categories. See pictures below. It **removes** other functionality that is not needed

Without this filter, items to distribute later that you masterloot to yourself to distribute later are put under "recent items" and later placed with your personal items. They can be difficult to find. I decided to write a plugin so they're in their own 2 categories: BoE (1) and other items with a remaining Timer (2).

⚠️ Tested on Wrath classic only, but should work for retail
