# AdiBags TradeableLoot
> Filters for BoE, BoA, and Soulbound categories in [AdiBags](https://github.com/AdiAddons/AdiBags).

By default, the addon will only sort BoE and BoA. Soulbound items can be
be filtered by equipable status as well, so that only gear will be moved.

You may also opt to filter Poor/Common (gray/white) quality BoE items, which have been
added in Retail version 10.0.5.

This is a plugin only! You can get the base bag addon over at [AdiAddons/AdiBags](https://github.com/AdiAddons/AdiBags) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/adibags).
